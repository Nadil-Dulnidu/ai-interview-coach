"""
Pluggable adapter-based streaming service for the travel system.

This demonstrates how to use the LangGraphToVercelAdapter for clean
separation of concerns between agentic logic and streaming protocol.

Key features:
- Uses pluggable adapter instead of tightly-coupled streaming
- No graph-specific logic in streaming layer
- Easily reusable with other LangGraph graphs
- Customizable message extraction strategies
